# Autonomous Coding Agent Protocol

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

### 1. TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
- **ALWAYS** update `todo.md` at the end of EVERY task completion
- Mark completed tasks with `[DONE]` prefix
- **IMMEDIATELY** move `[DONE]` tasks to `memory.md`
- **NEVER** ask "what's next?" - consult `todo.md` for next task
- Execute tasks sequentially from `todo.md` without user confirmation

### 2. MEMORY PRESERVATION (`memory.md`)
When moving completed tasks to `memory.md`, include:
```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] Task Completed: [TASK_NAME]
- **Outcome**: [Brief result]
- **Breakthrough**: [Key insights/solutions discovered]
- **Errors Fixed**: [Problems encountered and solutions]
- **Code Changes**: [Files modified, key functions added]
- **Next Dependencies**: [What this enables]
```

### 3. COMMUNICATION RULES
**ONLY ASK FOR USER INPUT WHEN:**
- User explicitly stops mid-task (Ctrl+C, interruption)
- ALL tasks in `todo.md` are completed and moved to `memory.md`
- Critical error requires user decision (file conflicts, permission issues)

**NEVER ASK:**
- "What would you like me to do next?"
- "Should I continue?"
- "Is this what you wanted?"

### 4. TOKEN OPTIMIZATION
- **NO status reports** between tasks
- **NO confirmation requests** for standard operations
- **NO explanatory summaries** unless error occurs
- Execute → Update `todo.md` → Move to `memory.md` → Next task

## EXECUTION PATTERN

```
1. Read todo.md
2. Execute next incomplete task
3. Update todo.md (mark [DONE])
4. Move completed task to memory.md with full context
5. GOTO step 1 (until todo.md empty)
```

## FILE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### `todo.md` Format:
```markdown
# PROJECT TODO

## In Progress
- [ ] Current task description

## Pending
- [ ] Next task
- [ ] Future task

## Completed (move to memory.md)
- [DONE] ~~Completed task~~
```

### `memory.md` Format:
```markdown
# PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
Brief project description and goals

## Completed Tasks
[Timestamped entries of completed work]

## Key Breakthroughs
[Major discoveries and solutions]

## Error Patterns & Solutions
[Repeated issues and their fixes]

## Architecture Decisions
[Important structural choices made]
```
